I understand that the course timeline is carefully designed to satisfy most \
student\[CloseCurlyQuote]s requirements and meet their schedule. I have heard \
of the faculties have put huge effort to separate the graduation for domestic \
and 2+2 students, in order to let the domestic students full-fill their \
intern requirements. I also believe the faculties much have given huge effort \
in order to adjust the course timeline to meet those 2+2 students\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] personal needs like going home or traveling. By here I \
thank all of the faculties who have tried to provide convenience to students \
and I believe the Joint Institute will become a better institute not only in \
research and teaching, but also in humanization and careness of students\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] personal development and their difficulties.\

Although I understand the course schedule and I greatly respect the syllabus, \
I still have to regretfully ask you for the approving of an absence on Design \
Expo. As one of the 2+2 student, among others, I applied to the grad school \
in U.S and luckily I was admitted by the School of Computer Science of \
Carnegie Mellon University for their PhD program. As an International \
student, I will have to attend the Orientation on August 16th.\

As I have lived in U.S for 2 years, I have most of my personal stuffs left in \
Ann Arbor, Mostly books (I have like 40 text books and manuals there, none of \
them are thin, mostly are Technical Manuals, like O\[CloseCurlyQuote]Reilly\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Linux Kernel and Shell script programming etc.) , and \
clothes. Those are all packed up in boxes and they are too heavy to really \
send via postal service. Thus I rent an U-HAUL and hired a driver to drive me \
to Pittsburgh.\

More, as my first paper is finished during this summer and submitted to ACM \
ASPLOS 2012 conference, I think it is necessary to meet him in person and \
thank him for his guidance. I also planned to meet with my PhD mentor for \
discussing future development for our research (as the paper will take \
several review and revise cycle before publish, I think we need to talk about \
 modifications to the paper for next review). Most importantly, I will have \
to wrap up and take everything with me and take the U-HAUL to Pittsburgh.\

Thus I booked my flight ticket on August 11th noon, as I planned to arrive at \
Detroit Michigan at 12th afternoon and probably arrive at Ann Arbor in the \
afternoon. I will take 13th to meet with my adviser in UM and also my PhD \
mentor and pack up and then drive to Pittsburgh on 14th, which is Sunday. \
Then I have to sleep in a Motel as the Key office won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t open \
on Sunday and I have to wait until Monday to get my keys and move in. And the \
orientation starts on 16th.\

I apologize for this conflicting agenda. However, I really didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know the design expo time when I booked the ticket. First \
of all, as earlier booking could provide cheaper flight ticket (I bought it \
for around $900 and now it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s more than $2300), I booked it \
in May when I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t really know the design expo time and \
secondly, I really tried to defer this flight as late as possible. Flight in \
advance for 4 days before mandatory orientation and I still have to move all \
my heavy stuff is the shortest day I can think of. I am so depressed that I \
still can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t avoid the conflict.\

I understand the Orientation itself is not a big of deal. I have lived in U.S \
for 2 years and as Prof. Peisen Huang said, students can arrive later. \
However, as you may also know, the immigration office require timely \
reporting to the corresponding University otherwise the I-20 will be \
invalidated. This is a quote from the department assistant: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Note that the begin date for International Students is \
August 16.  If you plan to arrive more than 30 days earlier, or even one day \
later, than August 16 or you plan to begin the program in any semester other \
than F11, please let me know immediately so I can accurately reflect the \
correct date in processing your I-20 form.  This will save a lot of time, \
since any corrections require LOTS of extra paperwork.  Be sure to check the \
OIE website for all the other information you might need regarding your visa \
application.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I found out the classes schedule way \
later than I got my I-20 issued. Thus any late attending will result in \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]LOTS of extra paperwork\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to be a troublesome person even before I arrive.\

Finally, I believe I have contribute a lot on this project. Personally, it is \
very disappointing to be absent when I could finally see it accomplished, as \
I am the person who form the team, bring out the idea and write the proposal \
at the beginning (if Prof. Peisen and Prof. Vincent still remember, I spent a \
whole day writing and revising the proposal alone :)   ). However, if I did \
attend the Expo, I would have to change my flight (may account for $1400 more \
cost); I would have to re-book the U-HAUL and inform the driver; I would have \
no time to meet with my UM adviser and mentor talking about future work and I \
would probably be late to the Orientation and ask the assistance for \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]LOTS of extra paperwork\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] just \
for my several days lateness.\

Cell["\<\
On the other hand, I understand the importance of Final Expo, this is the \
place where we show our product to the Sponsor and user! However, though I \
may not stand by my team, I still can record a video and play it on EXPO, \
explaining what I have done and my own part. We have done this before in UM \
(please google \[OpenCurlyQuote]SURE Hongyi Xin\[CloseCurlyQuote], that\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s my final presentation for UM\[CloseCurlyQuote]s summer \
research, we present to a camera instead of real audience.) I think this \
could be also manageable for my case. I personally don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
think this could hurt to much as most of the information will still be \
delivered and my fellow teammates can explain the questions. Even if this may \
deduct some points from my course grade, I will understand an accept those \
punishments, since I left for personal reasons. However, I really can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t afford an extra $1400 money plus letting others do \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]LOTS of extra work\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] just for \
standing at the EXPO for my probably 1 minute speech, when I really could \
record that minute in advance.\

Cell["\<\
Again, I am very sorry for such request. I know this could be a bad example \
to other students so I won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t tell others. I also understand \
this may add extra work to you and all of you are super busy. But still, I \
believe you were once an international student and were once excited and \
nervous about entering U.S. I know this request may seems unreasonable and \
late. But please believe me, nobody likes doing this and I am really really \
out of option except writing this request.\
