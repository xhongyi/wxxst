To install SVN, you first need an Linux. (Or macport http://www.macports.org/ ). I highly recommend using ubuntu (So you may get support from me). OpenSuse is also fine but I stopped using fedora or Redhat for a long time so I won't help you configure Fedora.

After Installing Ubuntu, you need to install java, eclipse, ssh and SVN.

To install svn, use ubuntu software package installation software: apt-get.

The full command would be:

sudo apt-get install subversion

To install java, please refer to this website: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java

To install Eclipse, please go to this website: http://www.eclipse.org/

To configure Andriod SDK, please go to this website: http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html

To install ssh, please use this command:

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

The tutorial is pretty much straight forward. If you encounter any problem. I strongly recommend you google and find the answer by yourself. None of us is professional on configuring the platform and learn how to use google itself is an extremely useful skill.
